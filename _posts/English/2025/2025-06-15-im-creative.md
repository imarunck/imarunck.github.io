People ask me what I do. Sometimes I say I'm a type designer. Sometimes graphic designer. Sometimes animation student. But honestly? I'm just **a creative**.

I create because **I can**, and because **I love to create**. That’s the only reason. Not to impress. Not for likes. Just to bring ideas into reality.

I'm not the kind of person who waits for the "perfect tool" or the "right time". I'm a **DIY person** — I’ll make a blog from scratch, edit videos, build an app, fix my PC, or even design a custom table. Once I made a cone-shaped LED light just to add some studio aesthetics. Why? Because I wanted to. Because I could.

I’m a creator who also cares about the **result**. I often ask, *“Is it useful? Is it sustainable? Will it last?”* I love **efficiency**, **simplicity**, and **things that don’t break easily** — whether it’s a font, a website, or a poster.

Yes, some people said my font *Anchu* was bad. But I made it with an open mind — not to be perfect, but to **learn**. Someone told me my graphic design poster was “nothing.” That’s okay too. It's just **one of the many things I do**. I’m not perfect yet, but I’m in the process. I believe in **compound growth**. In five years, I know I can be a good designer — or even great.

What matters to me most is not how it looks to others. What matters is **I made something**.

And that’s it.
That’s who I am.
