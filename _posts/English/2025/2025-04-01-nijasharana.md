## [nijasharana.com](https://nijasharana.com/) – A Tribute to Ambigara Chowdayya
Hello everyone,

I’m **Arun CK**, and I’m excited to share with you the journey of creating [**nijasharana.com**](https://nijasharana.com/), a dedicated website that celebrates and archives the life, vachanas, and values of **Vachanakaara Nijasharana Ambigara Chowdayya**.

This project was born out of respect for his revolutionary thoughts, deep wisdom, and social vision. Below is a timeline that explains how it all came together:


## 🛠 Project Timeline

### 📌 **December 2024**

-   The idea for the project sparked during my research on vachanas.
-   I started collecting resources, vachana data, and reference materials, especially from government archives like [Kanaja].

### 🖥️ **January 2025**

-   I began designing and developing the site.
-   Built the static site using HTML, CSS, and Jekyll — hosted on **GitHub & Cloudflare Pages**.
-   Images and illustrations were created by me, with valuable assistance from **ChatGPT** for structuring and organizing the content.

### 📅 **21st January 2025**

-   **Official Release** of [nijasharana.com](https://nijasharana.com) 🎉
-   Added:
    -   Vachanas with source credits
    -   Gallery section
    -   About page with credits and transparency

## 🎙️ Podcast + Social Media

We also launched the **"Nijasharana Vichara Vinimaya"** Podcast – a space for open thoughts, interviews, and discussions related to social justice, vachanas, and Ambigara Chowdayya’s philosophy.

-   Planned to host via RSS with major platforms like Spotify and YouTube.
-   Interview with **Dr. Dominic**, Director of Kannada Study Center, Bangalore University, is coming soon.
