## Kannada Placeholder Text? Here’s KanTumbu
One quiet Sunday, while working on a Kannada website design, I hit a wall.

Like every designer, I needed some placeholder text to mock up the layout. Usually, I’d paste the good old ’ Lorem Ipsum — and move on. But this time, it felt off. This was a Kannada UI, and Latin filler text looked totally out of place.

That’s when it hit me:
"Why not have Lorem Ipsum… in Kannada?"
That little eureka moment led to KanTumbu (ಕನ್‌ತುಂಬು) — a tiny tool built in a day, for designers like me who want Kannada placeholders.

So, What Is KanTumbu?
KanTumbu is a Kannada Lorem Ipsum Generator — a minimal web app that spits out non-meaningful, yet natural-looking, Kannada text.

No real words, no deep grammar — just lines that visually resemble real Kannada writing. Perfect for wireframes, UI mocks, typeface testing, posters, print layouts, and anywhere else you'd normally use filler text.

You enter how many paragraphs you want (up to 10), click a button, and boom — dummy Kannada paragraphs appear. Copy and paste. Done.

### Project Timeline:

The need hit me during a design mockup

The idea felt too good to postpone

I scribbled some gibberish Kannada-looking text (yes, handcrafted nonsense!)

Set up a basic index.html + style.css structure

Built a simple UI with a generator and copy button

Hosted it on GitHub Pages

### Wrote this blog, just to make the circle complete :)

## Why Does This Project Matter?
If you’ve ever worked on a Kannada app or website, you’ll know this:
Lorem Ipsum doesn’t feel native.

Using placeholder content in the same script and rhythm as your actual content helps:
* Spot design flaws (like font-size or spacing issues) early
* Align visual tone better with Kannada users
* Avoid distractions from foreign-looking text
* Build better Kannada-focused design systems

This tool fills that tiny gap — nothing big, but it’s practical, and it’s ours.

About the Name: "KanTumbu" (ಕನ್‌ತುಂಬು)
The name combines:
ಕನ್‌ = Kannada
ತುಂಬು = fill

So literally, it means "fill with Kannada".
Also, I like giving Kannada-flavored names to digital tools — it keeps them rooted.

## A Sunday Project — Because Why Not?
This wasn’t planned.
I didn’t sketch wireframes, write goals, or prep GitHub issues.

I just did it in a day — out of need, curiosity, and love for Kannada design.

Sometimes, the most useful things come out of the smallest ideas.
KanTumbu is one of those. Use it, share it, improve it if you want.

It’s open-source. It's yours too now.
