I died the day I was born,<br>
Death is the only certainty.<br>
I died when I was weak,<br>
I died when I was Ill.<br>

I have known death all my life,<br>
We all have to live with it.<br>
I have imagined so many of them,<br>
And yet have curiosity to know one.<br>

Sometimes I forgot human mortality,<br>
Then my endless illnesses kick in,<br>
To make me aware of that end!<br>
That ultimate end of nothingness.<br> 

When my body gives up on me,<br>
I start to wonder about existence.<br>
I think about consciousness.<br>
The possibility of human life.<br>

Who are we?<br>
Why are we?<br>
Is There a Creator?<br>
Is it an error in existence?<br>
What is the purpose?<br>
What to do with this life?<br>
Will We Know in the End?<br>
Or There is Nothing in the End?<br>

Maybe life is an error in existence,<br>
But we can make something of it.<br>
It's not from birth to death,<br>
It’s to exist in the Infinity of time.<br>
