## Hosting Sriraju Fonts on GitHub – A Step Toward Kannada Font Sustainability

Recently, I came across the Sriraju Kannada Font Family, which was originally shared online in 2019 by Sugata Srinivasaraju, a respected bilingual writer and journalist. The typeface was designed by Nagalingappa Badiger, a talented artist, illustrator, and type designer.

When I saw the fonts were available only via a Google Drive link, I felt the need to preserve them in a more sustainable and accessible way. Google Drive links can get broken, lost, or buried over time. For a typeface as meaningful as Sriraju, that would be a loss.

So, I decided to take a small step to help.

### What I Did ?
I created an unofficial GitHub repository to host the full font family here:  
🔗 [github.com/imarunck/Sri-Raju-Fonts](https://github.com/imarunck/Sri-Raju-Fonts)

## The repository includes:

* All 6 font files (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, Stencil, Stencil Italic)
* A specimen folder with a preview image
* A clear README.md with credits and description
* Proper folder structure and file names
* Attribution to Sugata Srinivasaraju as the publisher
* Proper credit to Nagalingappa Badiger as the typeface designer

I kept everything simple, clean, and respectful. The fonts are not modified — just better organized and made accessible in a developer- and designer-friendly way.

### Why It Matters ?
I care deeply about the Kannada language and script. As someone studying graphics and animation and also designing Kannada typefaces, I believe we need to preserve and share our visual language tools in sustainable ways.

Many Kannada fonts are scattered across blogs, PDFs, or download links with no long-term hosting. This makes it hard for designers, developers, and students to discover and use them in creative projects.

## Putting fonts like Sriraju on platforms like GitHub helps:
* Preserve them for the future
* Make them version-controlled and open
* Encourage others to use Kannada in digital spaces

## Response from Sugata Srinivasaraju
After I finished setting up the repository, I wrote a short email to Shri Sugata Srinivasaraju to let him know about it. He replied warmly:

>“Thank you so much. This is fantastic.
Best wishes,<br>
-Sugata”

That small note meant a lot to me.
