# Why I Failed with nijasharana.com

**By Arun CK**

When I look back at **nijasharana.com**, I don’t see a failed idea.
I see a **failed execution**, mainly due to practical constraints and hard lessons about domains, SEO, and sustainability.

This blog is my honest reflection on **why nijasharana.com failed**, what went wrong, and what I learned from it.

---

## The Original Intention

I started this project in **early 2025** with a clear and sincere intention:

To create a **digital platform** that documents and shares information about
**Nijashcharana Ambigara Chowdayya**, his vachanas, ideas, and the cultural space around **Ambigara Chowdayya and Ganga Mata communities**.

This was never meant to be a commercial project.
It was a **community-first, knowledge-first effort**.

---

## Why I Chose a Custom Domain

At that time, I believed that having a **custom domain** like:

> **nijasharana.com**

would give the project:

* Better credibility
* Better discoverability
* Better long-term identity

Technically, the website was well-built:

* Static site (HTML/CSS/Jekyll)
* Hosted on GitHub + Cloudflare Pages
* Fast, clean, and accessible
* Supported by structured content and archives

For a brief period, things worked.

---

## The Real Problem: Sustainability

The first real mistake was **underestimating sustainability**.

Domain names are not “one-time decisions”.
They are **recurring commitments**.

When the time came to **renew nijasharana.com**, I simply **did not have the funds** to continue paying for it.

There was no sponsor.
No institutional support.
No revenue model.

So the domain expired.

---

## Moving to a Subdomain: The Turning Point

To keep the project alive, I moved it to a subdomain:

> **nijasharana.arunck.com**

Technically, the site still worked.
The content was still there.
The intention was still pure.

But **from an SEO and discoverability perspective**, this was the breaking point.

### What went wrong after the move:

* Search engines treated it as a **new site**
* Original indexing was lost
* Authority from the old domain vanished
* Google started flagging it as **duplicate or low-trust content**
* Rankings dropped drastically
* Visibility almost disappeared

In short:
**The SEO was effectively killed.**

---

## Why This Feels Like a Failure

I call this a failure not because the idea was wrong,
but because:

* I didn’t plan for **long-term ownership**
* I underestimated **domain continuity**
* I learned SEO lessons **the hard way**
* I didn’t secure backing before branding the project around a standalone domain

For a content-driven cultural project, **domain instability is fatal**.

---

## What I Learned

This project taught me lessons no tutorial ever could:

1. **A domain is not just a name — it’s identity**
2. **SEO depends heavily on consistency and time**
3. **Subdomains are not neutral replacements**
4. **Cultural projects need institutional or community backing**
5. **Good intentions alone are not enough**

---

## Was It a Complete Failure?

No.

The content still exists.
The research still matters.
The work is still valid.

What failed was the **delivery mechanism**, not the purpose.

And that distinction is important.

---

## What Comes Next

For now, the project lives quietly under my main domain.
It may not rank well.
It may not get traffic.

But it stands as:

* Documentation
* Learning
* Experience
* A foundation for something better in the future

If I ever rebuild this project again, it will be:

* With stable funding
* With long-term planning
* With institutional or community collaboration
* With fewer assumptions and more realism

---

## Final Thoughts

Not every failure is loud.
Some are silent, technical, and invisible.

**nijasharana.com failed not because it lacked value,
but because it lacked sustainability.**

And that, for me, is a lesson worth writing down.
