## You reserve one in every thousand thoughts of my day.

I have not met you in a year,<br>
not called you in a year,<br>
not even texted you in a year.<br>

Why are you still there?<br>
When will this chain end?<br>
What are you to me?<br>

I remember you as if you were here,<br>
I remember it as if it were yesterday,<br>
I remember your words in your voice.<br>

Maybe I was not clear,<br>
maybe I never told you,<br>
maybe I did not find the words.<br>

It was my insecurity that held me back,<br>
maybe I should tell you now,<br>
maybe I am already too late.<br>

But I am sure I love you.<br>
You always reserve one in every<br>
thousand thoughts of my day.<br>
