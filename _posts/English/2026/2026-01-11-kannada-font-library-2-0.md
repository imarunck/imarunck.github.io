## Kannada Font Library 2.0 — A Better Tool for Kannada Typography

Kannada Font Library began as a simple idea: make Kannada fonts easier to discover and use. Over time, it became clear that listing fonts was not enough. What we needed was a better tool — something interactive, structured, and useful for real work.

That is where Kannada Font Library 2.0 comes in.

Why 2.0?

As someone with a background in design and an M.Sc. in Graphics and Animation, and as someone deeply interested in type design — especially Indian scripts like Kannada — I constantly felt a gap.

Kannada fonts are scattered.
Licensing is often unclear.
Comparing fonts before using them is difficult.

Designers, printers, students, and everyday users deserve a better experience.

Version 2.0 transforms Kannada Font Library from a static list into an interactive tool.

### What’s Improved?
1. Clean, Focused Interface - The platform now has a clearer structure and visual hierarchy. It’s easier to browse and compare fonts without distractions.

2. Live Type Testing -You can type your own Kannada text and instantly preview it across different fonts. This removes guesswork and makes font selection practical.

3. License-Based Filtering -Fonts can now be filtered by license type — OFL, End User, or Commercial — helping users understand usage rights before downloading.

4. Better Organization -Fonts from organizations and individual designers are clearly identified, making attribution and discovery easier.

### A Sustainable Direction

The project now lives at: [kfl.arunck.com](https://kfl.arunck.com/)

I chose not to continue with the previous domain. I do not want to run ads, and I prefer keeping this project simple and sustainable. Hosting it under my own domain ensures that the focus remains on utility, not monetization.

Kannada Font Library remains open-source and community-driven.

### Why This Matters

Typography shapes how a language appears in the digital world. When good tools are available, better design practices follow.

By making Kannada fonts easier to explore and test:

* Designers can make informed choices
* Printers can avoid compatibility issues
* Students can learn typography more effectively
* Developers can understand licensing clearly

This is a small contribution, but a meaningful one.

## An Open Invitation

This project is open.

If you are a designer, developer, student, or type enthusiast, you can explore it, suggest improvements, or contribute through GitHub.

Kannada deserves better digital tools.
This is one step in that direction.

And the journey continues.
