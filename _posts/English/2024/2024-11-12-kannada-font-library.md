# Kannada Font Library – A Platform I Built for Our Language

## How It All Started

On **July 9, 2023**, I created a small yet meaningful project called **Kannada Font Library** with a simple goal – to make Kannada fonts easily accessible to everyone.

As a designer and developer working in the Kannada language space, I often faced a recurring challenge: finding quality Kannada fonts. Google Fonts, one of the most popular font repositories, offers only **eight Kannada fonts**. For a language spoken by millions, this number felt unfair and limiting. There had to be a better way.

## Building Something Open for All

That’s when the idea struck – why not build a dedicated platform to collect, organize, and share Kannada fonts? So, I started the **Kannada Font Library** as an open-source project on GitHub. I kept it simple, clean, and focused. The goal wasn’t to compete with big platforms but to serve the needs of people who work with Kannada text — designers, students, educators, print professionals, and language lovers.

On **November 12, 2024**, I took the next big step and bought the custom domain **[kannadafontlibrary.in](https://kannadafontlibrary.in)** to make it easier for everyone to find and use the resource.

## Impact and Support

Since launching, the site has been quietly growing. **Over 150 unique visitors** use it daily — that’s 150 people finding the right Kannada fonts for their posters, documents, and digital designs.

One interaction stood out and reaffirmed the value of this project:  
A **professional from a printing press** reached out to me personally, just to say thank you. He appreciated having a single place to browse and download Kannada fonts without digging through outdated forums or broken links. That one message made my day and reminded me why I started this in the first place.

## What’s Next?

The project is still evolving. I’m thinking of improving the interface, adding font previews, filtering by category or license, and inviting more designers to contribute their Kannada typefaces.

My vision is to make **Kannada Font Library** the go-to hub for everything Kannada typography-related – whether you're a type designer, a school teacher, or someone just making a banner for your local event.

## A Small Effort with a Big Heart

I didn’t build this for fame or money. I built it because I love Kannada, and I believe our language deserves better tools and resources online.

If you’ve used the site, shared it, or contributed a font – **thank you**. You’re part of this story too.
