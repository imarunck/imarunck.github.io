I met you again.<br>
No, it was not you,<br>
Not the person I used to know.<br>

I thought we would catch up<br>
From where we left.<br>
Could tell you that I had the<br>
Best memories with you.<br>
But you forgot even the simplest parts of me.<br>

It's strange that we lived the same moments,<br>
I remember every second,<br>
While you figure out the year.<br>
Odd how we shared the same time,<br>
I can't forget them,<br>
But You had to be reminded.<br>

Sorry, my mistake.<br>
I was in my past,<br>
But it's your present.<br>
