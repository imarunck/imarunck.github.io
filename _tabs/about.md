> Typeface Designer.<br>

I’m Arun CK, a Kannada typeface designer based in Bengaluru.<br>
**I write to forget and to remember.**<br>
This space holds my stories, lived experiences, and thoughts that refuse to stay quiet.

Sometimes it’s reflection.<br>
Sometimes it’s poetry.<br>
Sometimes it’s kavite, kavana.<br>

I write to understand.<br>
I write because some things need language.

If you’re a poet or writer and want a website for your poems or writing,
feel free to reach out below — let’s build something meaningful together.<br>
